# solidify 
# for all points, after one round of a/b, the point is kept and are safe from future a/b.
# pro: incentivize buying; con: punishing late joiner  
# use price increase speed to strike a balance  with continuous a/b and open game 

# stealing is 1.8x, bc the point wouldn't be eliminated in a/b anymore 
# 1.2x goes to victim recoup, 0.6x goes to pot 
# 0.2x to defend, goes to pot (fake money) / dev team (real money) 

# point owner 
# defend is expensive but can keep the effective points  
# want to acquire more points early bc it's cheaper, but it needs more defend -> estimated optimal point 

# point seeker 
# buy is cheap but need to go through one round of a/b 
# steal is expensive but that point is guarantee valuable  

# fake vs real money 
# fake money - everyone plays with the same amount money. more skill and entrance fee based.   
# fake money - players might run out of fake money and the game still hasn't ended - they need to pull someone new 
# real money - might scare off conservative people. more fun for risk-tolerant people. 
# real money - can have level of participation of all sizes - "buy one point, defend." 

# what if point price doesn't grow, and with solidify? 
    # there is no time difference to buy or steal. it's the same at any point of the game. 
    # doesn't deter newcomer at all. 
    # why would anyone buy early then? with price increase, they buy early to take advantage, and they have the obligation to finish the game.  

# question 
# anyone can kick anyone out of a tg chat. is that an issue? 

# conclusion 
# steal 1.8x (1.7 recoup, 0.1 dev); 0.2x defend (dev); 1x buy; solidify -> try
